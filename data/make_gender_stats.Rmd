# Schooling and fertility

Here we are processing a dataset from the World Bank on gender and
inequality.

I got the dataset from these pages.

* [https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/gender-statistics](https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/gender-statistics)

The dataset that I'm using is one I downloaded sometime soon before 16 September 2017.  I'm using that version of the dataset because it has entries for health expenditure per capita, that current downloads do not have.

If you want tolatest version of these data, you can get them as a zip file [from that
site](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/Gender_Stats_csv.zip). 

Here is the September 2017 version of the data, extracted from the corresponding zip file:

* [2017 Gender_StatsData.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/17803301)

The last is the link I'm using below.

```{python}
# Import Pandas with its usual short name
import pandas as pd
```

Load the Comma Separated Value text file into Pandas as a data frame:

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/17803301')
```

This is a slightly clumsy-looking data frame, because it has years for
columns, and variables for rows, where there are 630 variables for each
country.  So there are 630 rows \* the number of countries.  To investigate,
we first look at the column names:

```{python}
df.columns
```

Next we look at the first few rows of the data frame:

```{python}
df.head()
```

There are lots of countries here, so to start, letâ€™s look at the variables for
the UK.

We get the UK country code from [http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/ctycodes.htm](http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/ctycodes.htm).
The code is `GBR`.

```{python}
# We select only the UK rows
gb = df[df['Country Code'] == 'GBR']
gb
```

Pandas truncates the output to only show a certain number of rows, and only a
certain length for the text fields.  To investigate further, you can increase
these limits to see all 630 rows for the UK, and more of the text for the text
fields:

```{python}
# See more of the text, more rows in the displayed output
pd.options.display.max_colwidth = 80
pd.options.display.max_rows = 700
```

If you are working in the Notebook, you will now see all of the rows and the
whole text field with the variable description.

```{python}
# This will be different from above when working in the Notebook
gb
```

We need to reduce the data.  Let us start by trying to reduce the number of missing values.  Here are the number of valid observations for some recent years:

```{python}
for year in range(2008, 2018):
    print(year, df[str(year)].count())
```

```{python}
recent = df[[str(year) for year in range(2012, 2017)]]
recent.columns
```

Let's try taking the average of 2012 through 2016. This automatically discards missing (NA) values.

```{python}
recent_mean = recent.mean(axis=1)
recent_mean.count()
```

We only want the first three columns of the data frame - the rest are year values, many of which are missing.  Drop the columns after the fourth, and then add back the 2012 through 2016 data.

```{python}
thin_df = df[['Country Name', 'Country Code', 'Indicator Name']].copy()
thin_df['recent_mean'] = recent_mean.copy()
thin_df
```

```{python}
cols = ['Country Code', 'Country Name']
country_lookup = thin_df[cols].groupby(cols).nth(0).reset_index()
country_lookup
```

This data frame is still a mess, with a new row for each variable.  We can
solve this using the Pandas
[pivot](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reshaping.html) function
to push the rows up into columns, thus:

```{python}
pivoted = thin_df.pivot(index='Country Code',
                        columns='Indicator Name',
                        values='recent_mean')
pivoted.columns
```

Now we have 630 columns, one per variable, and 263 rows, one per country.

```{python}
pivoted.shape
```

Many of these columns have a lot of missing values.  Which columns have at least 220 non-missing values?

```{python}
cols_ok = [name for name in pivoted.columns if pivoted[name].count() > 220]
[(name, pivoted[name].count()) for name in cols_ok]
```

We will use some of these columns.  The current column names are the whole description.  These are hard to use.  Here's a function to do a first pass in stripping the description down into something more like a variable name.

```{python}
def col_proc(cname):
    if '(' in cname:  # Drop phrase in parentheses
        cname = cname[:cname.index('(')]
    return '_'.join(word.lower()[:3] for word in cname.split())
```

Print out the long description and the first-pass variable name the function returns:

```{python}
[(name, col_proc(name)) for name in cols_ok]
```

After copy-pasting this output into a text editor, and reflecting for a bit, these variables seem useful.  I've hand-edited the variable names to make them a bit clearer:


```{python}
# (Description, Variable name) pairs.
# I've edited the Variable name by hand in a text editor.
renamers = [
    ('Fertility rate, total (births per woman)', 'fert_rate'),
    ('GDP (current US$)', 'gdp'),
    ('Health expenditure per capita, PPP (constant 2011 international $)', 
     'health_exp_per_cap'),
    ('Health expenditure, public (% of GDP)', 'health_exp_pub'),
    ('Primary education, pupils (% female)', 'prim_ed_girls'),
    ('Maternal mortality ratio (modeled estimate, per 100,000 live births)',
     'mat_mort_ratio'),
    ('Population, total', 'population')
]
```

Create a new, much smaller data frame, using these columns.  Rename the columns with the new names.

```{python}
gender_stats = pivoted[[name for (name, rename) in renamers]]
gender_stats.columns = [rename for (name, rename) in renamers]
gender_stats
```

Add back the country name:

```{python}
gender_stats = gender_stats.merge(country_lookup, on='Country Code')
# Reorder Country Name to front
cols = list(gender_stats)
gender_stats = gender_stats[[cols[-1]] + cols[:-1]]
gender_stats
```

There are a number of not-countries in the remaining rows.  For example `ARB` is not a valid country code.   To remove these, we use the standard list of countries from the [UN statistics division website](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/overview).

```{python}
un_countries = pd.read_csv('un_stats_division_countries.csv')
un_countries.head()
```

```{python}
iso3 = un_countries['ISO-alpha3 Code']
iso3.head()
```

Check which rows have a country code in the UN list:

```{python}
valid_country = gender_stats['Country Code'].isin(iso3)
valid_country.head()
```

Check the country names of countries with apparently invalid country codes:

```{python}
bad_countries = gender_stats[~valid_country][['Country Code', 'Country Name']]
bad_countries
```

[Kosovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo) seems like it might be a valid country. Add this back to the valid countries:

```{python}
valid_country[gender_stats['Country Code'] == 'XKX'] = True
```

Select data for the valid countries:

```{python}
valid_gender_stats = gender_stats.loc[valid_country]
valid_gender_stats.head()
```

The GDP is in dollars, giving some annoying exponential numbers.  Can we store this value in billions of dollars, without making lots of small numbers?

```{python}
gdp_us_billion = valid_gender_stats['gdp'] / 1e9
gdp_us_billion.sort_values()[:20]
```

```{python}
gender_stats_2014 = valid_gender_stats.copy()
gender_stats_2014.loc[:, 'gdp'] = gdp_us_billion
gender_stats_2014 = gender_stats_2014.rename(columns={'gdp': 'gdp_us_billion'})
# We will later need to change the name for later output in the data dictionary.
renamers = [t if t != ('GDP (current US$)', 'gdp')
            else ('GDP (current US billion $)', 'gdp_us_billion')
            for t in renamers]
gender_stats_2014.head()
```

Rename country columns to harmonize with format of other names:

```{python}
gender_stats_2014 = gender_stats_2014.rename(
    columns={'Country Name': 'country_name',
             'Country Code': 'country_code'})
gender_stats_2014.head()
```

Write the resulting data frame out to CSV.

```{python}
gender_stats_2014.to_csv('gender_stats_2012_16.csv', index=False)
```

Read it back in to check it's what we were expecting:

```{python}
gs_back = pd.read_csv('gender_stats_2012_16.csv')
gs_back.head()
```

We should write a data dictionary too.  We will have to backslash escape dollars for the Markdown output.

```{python}
with open('gender_stats_data_dict.md', 'wt') as fobj:
    fobj.write('# Gender statistics data dictionary\n\n')
    for name, rename in renamers:
        name = name.replace('$', '\$')  # For Markdown
        fobj.write(f'* `{rename}`: {name}.\n')
```
